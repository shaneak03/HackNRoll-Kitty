<confused> "Why is binary search so fast, explained by cats?"
<confused> "Well, imagine Kitty trying to find his favorite toy in a sorted pile of yarn balls."
<confused> "Kitty starts by investigating the middle ball."
<confused> "If it's his toy, Kitty's day is made!"
<confused> "If not, and the toy is smaller, he ignores the right half and checks the left."
<confused> "If bigger, he skips the left and checks the right."
<confused> "Kitty repeats this until he finds his toy or runs out of yarn balls."
<confused> "This method is way faster than checking each one, especially when Kitty is in a hurry!"
