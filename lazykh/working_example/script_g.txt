"Why is binary search so fast, explained by cats?"
"Well, imagine Kitty trying to find his favorite toy in a sorted pile of yarn balls."
"Kitty starts by investigating the middle ball."
"If it's his toy, Kitty's day is made!"
"If not, and the toy is smaller, he ignores the right half and checks the left."
"If bigger, he skips the left and checks the right."
"Kitty repeats this until he finds his toy or runs out of yarn balls."
"This method is way faster than checking each one, especially when Kitty is in a hurry!"
