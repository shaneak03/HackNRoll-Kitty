00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,399
Why is binary search so fast explained by

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:02,930
cats

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,450
Well imagine Kitty trying to find his favorite

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,550
toy in a sorted pile of yarn balls

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,669
Kitty starts by investigating the middle ball If

6
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,160
it's his toy Kitty's day is made

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,210
If not and the toy is smaller he

8
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,810
ignores the right half and checks the left

9
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:17,760
If bigger he skips the left and checks

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,229
the right

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,829
Kitty repeats this until he finds his toy

12
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,019
or runs out of yarn balls

13
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,049
This is way faster than checking each one

14
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,910
especially when Kitty is in a hurry
